# PBR Material Viewer

A simple PBR/IBL material viewer with drag and drop functionality written in C++/OpenGL.

[![Real-time PBR](http://img.youtube.com/vi/5Qgu7ap8vvs/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qgu7ap8vvs)

### Features

* Drag and drop an equirectangular HDR image in the viewport to automatically generate the required cubemaps for Image-Based Lighting ([hdrlabs has a nice collection of environment maps](http://www.hdrlabs.com/sibl/archive.html)).
* Drag and drop individual images in the material components (albedo, normal, metallic, roughness, ambient occlusion, displacement) to change the material's appearance ([freepbr has a nice collection of different material textures](https://freepbr.com/)).
* Adjust the displacement amount and texture scale.
* Toggle rotation and wireframe.
* Toggle and move a point-light around the scene.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Please note that Windows is the only supported platform at the moment.

### Prerequisites

* A modern C/C++ compiler
* OpenGL 3.3+
* CMake 3.0+ installed

### Building the project

#### Git clone

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/FrMarchand/pbr-material-viewer.git
 cd pbr-material-viewer
```

#### Generate project files

```bash
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
```

You can then open the generated project files in your IDE or build the project directly with cmake

#### Build with CMake

```
cmake --build . --config Release
```

使用VS2019打开此解决方案(.sln)然后编译时，出现很多glfw的错误。这是因为该项目提供的glfw3.lib版本和自己的编译环境(OS和IDE)不兼容，需要从网上下载适用于自己系统(win10,64位)和IDE(VS2019)的glfw文件，就可以编译通过。

运行这个demo后，把自己的环境贴图(.hdr)和pbr材质贴图(albedo,normal,roughnes和displacement等文件)拖动到相应的位置，就可以看到效果了。

In order to keep things simple, building this project will generate a standalone executable. Shaders and other resources are embedded in the program during compilation.
